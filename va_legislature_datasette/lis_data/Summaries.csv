provisions of the Code that currently require one hour of paid sick leave for

employers and state and local governments. The bill requires that employees who
are employed and compensated on a fee-for-service basis accrue paid sick leave
in accordance with regulations adopted by the Commissioner of Labor and
Industry. The bill provides that employees transferred to a separate division
or location remain entitled to previously accrued paid sick leave and that
employees retain their accrued sick leave under any successor employer. The
bill allows employers to provide a more generous paid sick leave policy than
prescribed by its provisions. Employees, in addition to using paid sick leave
for their physical or mental illness or to care for a family member, may use
paid sick leave for their need for services or relocation due to domestic
abuse, sexual assault, or stalking.</p>

<p class=sumtext>The bill provides that certain health care workers who work no
more than 30 hours per month may waive the right to accrue and use paid sick
leave. The bill also provides that employers are not required to provide paid
sick leave to certain health care workers who are employed on a pro re nata, or
as-needed, basis, regardless of the number of hours worked. The bill requires
the Commissioner to promulgate regulations regarding employee notification and
employer recordkeeping requirements.</p>

<p class=sumtext>The bill authorizes the Commissioner, in the case of a knowing
violation, to subject an employer to a civil penalty not to exceed $150 for the
first violation, $300 for the second violation, and $500 for each successive
violation. The Commissioner may institute proceedings on behalf of an employee
to enforce compliance with the provisions of this bill. Additionally, an
aggrieved employee is authorized to bring a civil action against the employer
in which he may recover double the amount of any unpaid sick leave and the
amount of any actual damages suffered as the result of the employer's
violation. The bill has a delayed effective date of January 1, 2025.</p>

The Review Board is required to determine if the critical  interconnection project (i) qualifies as a project of statewide significance,  defined in the bill, and (ii) complies with the ordinance in each locality in  which the proposed critical interconnection project would be located. In making  its determination, the Review Board is required to consider the Commonwealth  Clean Energy Policy, certain regulations adopted by the State Air Pollution  Control Board, the certain renewable portfolio requirements, and any other  information it deems relevant. The bill provides that the Review Board has the  discretion to disregard any unreasonable restriction, defined in the bill, in  the local ordinance on the installation of the critical interconnection  projects or the building of structures that facilitate the installation of  critical interconnection projects. In addition, the Review Board may consider  any regional energy plan developed by the relevant planning district  commission. The Review Board is required to issue its opinion on the critical  interconnection project within 90 days of receiving an application.</p>  <p class=sumtext>The bill requires a locality to issue its final decision  regarding any zoning change, variance, or the issuance of a special exemption,  special use permit, or conditional use permit related to a critical  interconnection project no later than 180 days after receiving a critical  interconnection opinion issued by the Review Board. If the locality's final  decision diverges from the Review Board's opinion, the locality is required to  include a written determination setting forth all facts and conclusions reached  by the locality that support its final decision. Under the bill, a locality's  failure to make a final decision within the 180-day period, constitutes a  granting of the zoning change, variance, special exemption, special use permit,  or conditional use permit related to a critical interconnection project.</p>  <p class=sumtext>The bill requires that any appeal of a locality's decision  related to a critical interconnection project will be filed in the circuit  court of such locality.

Under the bill, in any such appeal, there is a rebuttable presumption that the  opinion of the Review Board is correct. Such presumption may be overcome by a  preponderance of the evidence that the locality's decision to grant or deny a  project or to include the challenged conditions was consistent with provisions  in the locality's ordinance that are not unreasonable restrictions. </p>  <p class=sumtext>This bill is a recommendation of the Commission on Electric  Utility Regulation."
